    XOL_BRIEF_HISTORY:0 "In 1987 Xolonia regained independence from Ostryae but they have took a majority of the gold in those lands. Ostreya still doesn't recognize Xolonia as a indepent nation, and many Xolonians want to fight Ostreya for revenge and are angry because they left the country alone. In 2023 Xolonia is still recovering from that cultural and economical massacare but Ostreya claims the lands as theirs. "
